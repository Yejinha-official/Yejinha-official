- 👋 Hi, I’m Yejin. 

- 👀 I’m interested in TDD and BDD.
I consider programming skill as a tool for solving anything I wish to make a change.   
For that, I have to pinpoint what I want to do (Behavior) and how can I make it happen as exactly I plan to. (Pass the test case) 

- 🌱 My main programming language is Java and Javascript and I like to use Selenium as an automation tool.
