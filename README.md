- 👋 Hi, I’m Yejin. I'm a backend developer with 3 years of experience. 

- 👀 I consider my programming skill as a tool for solving anything I wish to make a change.   
For that, I have to pinpoint what I want to do and how can I make it happen as exactly I plan to. 
I like to come up with new idea and design milestones to carry it out. 

- 🌱 My main programming language is Java and Javascript and I like to use Selenium as an automation tool.

    - [ ] Personal blog project using Spring boot, AWS , Mustache [this] (https://github.com/Yejinha-official/MyBoardProgject)
